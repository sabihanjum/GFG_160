"""You are given the head of a singly linked list. Your task is to determine if the linked list contains a loop. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop."""

class Solution:
    #Function to check if the linked list has a loop.
    def detectLoop(self, head):
        #code here
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
