"""Given a single string s, the task is to check if it is a palindrome sentence or not. A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters, such as word, phrase, or series of symbols that reads the same backward as forward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters."""
